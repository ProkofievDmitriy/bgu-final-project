%%%	This module is the general stats server interface for the PLC+RF smart-meter project.
%%%
%%%	This module is used to send information to the stats server about the messages passing through the node.
%%%
%%%	The statical data that is gathered is:
%%%	
%%%		Number of data messages sent
%%%		Number of data messages received
%%%		Number of management message sent
%%%		Number of management message received
%%%
%%%	TODO:
%%%		Calculate average message time for arrival to destination.
